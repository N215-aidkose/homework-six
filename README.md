This assigment was definitely pushing me to think more about how I am making my initial code. Most of my issues were because the code I was changing was not well setup for being responisve. I also realized that I misunderstood the directions. When asked to make the page responsive to 800px, I thought that meant to make it change at 800px and be able to scale to any viewport under that. When I realized I just had to scale it for 800px and a little below, my work became much more straightforward. I believe I did everything i needed to do.
